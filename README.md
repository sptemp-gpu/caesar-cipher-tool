## 🧩 Usage

### 🔁 Caesar Cipher

**Encrypt:**
1. Enter the text to be encrypted.
2. Specify the shift value (an integer).
3. Click **Encrypt**.

**Decrypt:**
1. Use the same shift value (or negative of the original shift).
2. Click **Decrypt**.

### 🔐 Vigenère Cipher

**Encrypt:**
1. Enter your text.
2. Provide a key (a string).
3. Click **Encrypt**.

**Decrypt:**
- Use the same key, and click **Decrypt**.

### 🧱 AES Encryption

**Encrypt:**
1. Enter your text.
2. Enter a password to use as the AES key.
3. Click **Encrypt**.

**Decrypt:**
- Provide the same password used during encryption and click **Decrypt**.

### 📁 File Operations

- **Load** and **Save** encrypted text from files.
- Perform **batch processing** for multiple files at once.

### 🆘 Real-time Help

- Built-in help options are available in the GUI to guide new users.
